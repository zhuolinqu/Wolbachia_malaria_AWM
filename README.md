## Overview

This work presents a mathematical modeling framework to assess the potential of *Wolbachia*-based interventions in reducing malaria transmission. The model captures both mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission processes, with simulation studies informed by biologically relevant parameters.

The repository includes code to reproduce all key simulation results and figures presented in the paper.

## Repository Contents

- `set_workspace.m` — **Run this first** to set the working directory paths correctly.  
- `Run_*.m` — Scripts prefixed with `Run_` reproduce the figures and results from the paper.
- `Results/` — Output folder where all figures and data files will be saved.
- Additional scripts and functions used by the `Run_` scripts.

## Requirements

- All codes are developed in MATLAB 2023a/2023b
